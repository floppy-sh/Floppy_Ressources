# SSH

### Local Port Forwarding

Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port on the local (ssh client) machine to a port on the remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a port on the destination machine.

```bash
ssh -L <ATTACKER_PORT>:localhost:<TARGET_PORT> <USER>@<TARGET_IP>
```

### Remote Port Forwarding

Remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port forwarding. It allows you to forward a port on the remote (ssh server) machine to a port on the local (ssh client) machine, which is then forwarded to a port on the destination machine.

```bash
ssh -R <ATTACKER_PORT>:<ATTACKER_IP>:<TARGET_PORT> <USER>@<TARGET_IP>
```

### Dynamic Port Forwarding

Dynamic port forwarding allows you to create a socket on the local (ssh client) machine, which acts as a SOCKS proxy server. When a client connects to this port, the connection is forwarded to the remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a dynamic port on the destination machine.

```bash
ssh -D <ATTACKER_PORT> <USER>@<TARGET_IP> -fN
```

Options:

* `f`: Requests ssh to background itself after authentication
* `N`: Tells ssh not to execute a remote command (empty command)
