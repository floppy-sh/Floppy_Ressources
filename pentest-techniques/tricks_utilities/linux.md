# Linux

## Interactive shells

Sometimes, after exploiting a vulnerability, you get a shell that is not very interactive and that can break after a bad manipulation. Here are some tools and techniques that you can use to upgrade to **a more interactive** shell.

### rlwrap

**rlwrap** _is a "readline wrapper", a small utility that uses the_ [_GNU Readline_](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) _library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any command_.

#### Installation

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>git clone https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap.git
</strong><strong>cd rlwrap
</strong><strong>./configure;
</strong>make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

#### Usage

```bash
rlwrap [-options] <command> <args>
# Example: get an interactive reverse shell
rlwrap nc -lvnp <IP> <PORT>
```
